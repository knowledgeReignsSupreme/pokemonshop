If you always wanted to own pokemons yourself, now there's no need to get out and catch 'em all!
<br />
Now you can stay home and buy 'em all! Pokemon shop lets you buy multiple types of pokemons

## For this project I used:

- React (With class based components) <img width="15" src="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/react-js/react.png" style="vertical-align: middle" /> <br />

- Css Modules <img width="15" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg/1200px-CSS3_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png" style="vertical-align: middle" /> <br />

- This project has a tiny dependencies list in order to be made simple and focus on class based components <br />
